I added addedAuthor parameter in updateCache function because we need to update ALL_AUTHORS query if we want to see updated number of books in Author view.

Also I noticed this thing: as you know, updateCache function in App.js is used for manipulating cache, and eliminate saving same book twice. And we use this function not only in App.js, but in NewBook.js too. And I thought that it would be no difference and do not cause saving rendering one book twice if we use standard client.cache.updateQuery instead of our's updateCache in NewBook.js. But it turned out, that it's not true and in that case book would be rendered twice. And it seemed strange to me: why this happen if updateCache in Ap.js should eliminate saving same book twice? Then after logging in in App and NewBook.js, I came to conlusion, that this updateCache function triggerd before client.cache.updateQuery in NewBook.js. And at first there is no such a book in cache, so it add it. But then client.cache.updateQuery starts to update cache, and add the same book to the cache, and as result on the screen we see 2 same books. Maybe my thoughts are wrong, but I don't see another explanation.
